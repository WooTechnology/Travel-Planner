##Travel-Planner
A web based application which aims to provide a complete travelling package to traveller along with all the booking stuffs such as hotel booking, travel booking, Food, etc., handled on the platform itself. Moreover, the travellers can see the photos of the destination they desire to visit and can compare multiple destinations. User can share their pictures which would help others to get more insights about the destination. Eg: suppose me and my 2 friends are planning to visit delhi then, there will be certain plans available on the website showing different packages and we can choose among them. This can depend on the the number of places to visit associated with each package or the type of hotel etc.
